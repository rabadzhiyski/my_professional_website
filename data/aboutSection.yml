  ### I design and build robust data science solutions.

  I love helping companies and people. My passion is data science. But, when I am not consulting 
  or building software, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends.
  
  
  My area of focus is applying AI and data science to business. I create value by 
  understanding the financial cost of problems and delivering a return-on-investment with my solutions. 
  I enjoy learning, working with people, and using technology to solve problems.
