  ### I design and build robust data science products.

  I love helping companies and people. My passion is data science. But, when I am not consulting or building software, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends.
  
  
  My area of focus is applying data science to business. I create value for companies by understanding the financial cost of problems and delivering a return-on-investment with my solutions. I enjoy learning, working with stakeholders, and making better decisions with data.
